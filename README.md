Cannon Sheep
================

With this mod you can cannonize your sheep!  Once they are cannonized, you can load them with TNT and fire with flint and steel!

Written as a diving-head-first-into-mod-making mod so it might be a bit shabby as I figure things out.

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.7.2
- Forge Mod Loader

## To Do:

- Figure out exact interaction with loading TNT.  A GUI may be better.
- Figure out if there's a way to prevent the sheep looking back straight ahead when you put away the wheat.
- Finish other Cannon Sheep behavior.
- Write and Texture Feed Bag.
- Cannon Sheep Models!
- Write replacement for Techne. (OR just help finish writing Techne Online Edition...)
- Rewrite mod in Scala.
